# 📝 Youtube Downloader

This project was developed following an assignment given to us by Prof. **** ******. It was developed individually using the theoretical topic covered on *Web Services*, therefore SOAP and REST type APIs, and the use of TailwindCSS. Both the presentation and the application were created using the English language to promote development in foreign language presentation skills in view of the state exam through the CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) approach.

## 📕 Manual

### 🗄️ Server

Before proceeding, it is necessary to have Tomcat installed on your device, in addition to obviously a version of Java higher than Java 8 (the JDK22 is used in the demonstrative example). The simplest method to have them is to access this site [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html), then download and install the latest version. Once all this is done, open the XAMPP control panel and enable the “Tomcat” section as in the following screenshot.

Proceed with the deployment of the applications via tomcat, importing the files “06_YoutubeDownloader.war” (findable in the release section) and “06_YoutubeAPI” (findable in the release section of this [page](https://github.com/SamOraDur/06_YoutubeAPI) ), and proceeding with the start of the applications.
